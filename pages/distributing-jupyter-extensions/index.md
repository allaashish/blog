Title: Distributing Jupyter Notebook Extensions
Date: 2016-05-08

Last year, I described [four ways of extending Jupyter Notebook](/4-ways-to-extend-jupyter-notebook/). I left off with a note about how the community was discussing best practices for shipping Jupyter extensions. Since then, the Jupyter platform has continued to evolve. With the 4.2 release of Jupyter Notebook, there is now a well-defined way of distributing frontend and server-side extensions in Python packages. The Jupyter documentation describes the general developer and user workflow.

In this post, I'd like to give a more particular example of creating a combined Notebook client/server extension, packaging it as a wheel, pushing it to PyPI, and installing it into a conda environment. 

## The Extension

## Project Setup

## Server Extension

## JavaScript Extension

## Extension Metadata

## Python Package
