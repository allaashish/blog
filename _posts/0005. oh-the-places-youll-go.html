title: Oh! The places you'll go!

<p>For those who read this, I'm not longer working on GNOME accessibility projects for IBM. I've been transfered to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckGfhlZW0BY">QEDWiki</a> project, and may or may not have accessibility duties in the long run, but possibly some in the short term.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I'm writing up some final documentation on LSR in hope that someone will find it useful:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~parente/lsr/pguide/">patterns document</a> stating ways to solve different problems using the existing Perk scripting sytem.</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~parente/lsr/retro">LSR in retrospect document</a> starting what I would change, if I were starting over again today</li>
</ol>

<p>I may work on making the latter changes myself in my spare time. I can see some usefulness is having a basic accessibility engine which I can use to script certain desktop actions or speech enable specific applications. For instance, maybe I want to listen to changes in a particular window (e.g. console with tail -f running, gaim chat window). Maybe I want some pre-recorded macros that perform a specific set of actions across applications that do not make their models public through dbus or another API. Or maybe I want a small toolbox window to augment an application with functions that aren't immediately available in its toolbar.</p>

<p>I still plan on contributing to GNOME accessibility. I have some patches outstanding for pygtk that will allow widgets drawn with pycairo to become visible to AT-SPI clients (e.g. Orca, Accerciser, GOK). I just have to find time to work on them.</p>
