<p>I never watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/">Buffy</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/">Firefly</a> on TV, but seeing the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/">Serenity</a> and then purchasing the Firefly DVD set turned me on to Joss Whedon. He's taken his talents online now with a three act musical, Dr. Horrible.</p>

<p>I didn't know what to think of the opening with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000439/">Neil Patrick Harris</a> (Dr. Horrible) recording his vlog. But as soon as he started singing, I started laughing. By the time <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0277213/">Nathan Fillion</a> (Captain Hammer) appeared, I was loving it.</p>

<p>Acts II and III are due in a few days. Catch them before they disappear.</p>
