<p>I'm alive and kicking. You wouldn't know it looking at this blog. Or my Twitter account. Or my (deleted) Facebook account. But, yep, I'm still here.</p>

<p><img style="width:33%" class="inlineRight" src="/images/posts/0032-j4.jpeg" />I know I have not had much of an online presence for the past two years. There are two main reasons for my hiatus. First, my then-toddler-now-pre-K daughter. Weekends spent coding, evenings spent catching up on RSS feeds, and spare minutes spent tweeting have been replaced with educational trips, outdoor sports, and moments of ad-hoc dancing and laughing. I believe this change is a "good thing" for all parties involved. I hope it persists. (And, FYI, I still can and do code after kiddo's 7:30 PM bedtime.)</p>

<p>Second, <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/">Watson</a>. Nearly all of my compute time, at work and at home, for the past two years has been spent working on the Big W. I cannot share details, but suffice to say my horizons have been <em>greatly</em> expanded. I've gained new knowledge about distributed systems, machine learning, natural language processing, applied statistics, and data science. Not to mention, experience with new tools (I &#x2764; <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython Notebook</a>), practice leading a small part of a big team under pressure, and many new contacts. It's been all-consuming, yet enlightening.</p>

<p>I'm now transitioning to a new project at work. I do so armed with all that I've learned in the past two years, both about my discipline from Watson and life from my family. I hope to share more about my experience this time around.</p>

<p>Or, at least, only let <em>one</em> year pass between postings this time.</p>
