<p><img class="inlineRight" width="128" height="128" src="/images/parente.jpg" /> Peter Parente is a software developer in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM's</a> Emerging Internet Technology group. His past responsibilities included developing IBM's <a href="http://live.gnome.org/LSR">Linux Screen Reader</a> and the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Accerciser">Accerciser</a> testing tool; working on the accessibility infrastructure of the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME desktop</a>; participating in the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/">User Agent Accessibility Working Group</a> (UAAG); and contributing to the <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/qedwiki/">QEDWiki</a> and <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/mashuphub/">Mashup Hub</a> projects, the proof-of-concept software that spurred the development of the <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/info/mashup-center/">IBM Mashup Center</a> product. Currently he is part of IBM's <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ebusiness/jstart/bluespruce/">Project Blue Spruce</a>, an investigation of cooperative Web concepts.</p>

<p>Peter holds a Ph.D. in <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu">computer science</a> from the <a href="http://www.unc.edu/">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>. The topic of his <a href="/clique">dissertation</a> is perceptually based, task oriented auditory displays for GUI applications. His goal was, and still is, to show that we can do better than reading the screen for many people with visual impairments and benefit mobile sighted users at the same time.</p>

<p>Parente's vocational and research interests include accessibility, usability, auditory display, visualization, and model-based user interfaces. He is a <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> hacker-enthusiast, but has lived in the land of JavaScript as of late.</p>
